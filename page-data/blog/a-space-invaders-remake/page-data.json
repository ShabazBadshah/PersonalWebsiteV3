As mentioned above I wish that I had a stricter planning and development process.

As you can imagine, this was in no way effective, but as a newbie I was ignorant of the fact of how a good plan can lead to a much faster and more easily maintainable code.

In the same vein, learning object oriented programming in the process was a vital step to learning the basics of programming (as this was one of my primary objectives of this undertaking). As an avid gamer, I definitely garnered a new found appreciation for game development, and software development in general. In addition, learning simple photoshop to create simple sprites for the game was a much lesser challenge then trying to figure out how to actually implement the game, but I ultimately managed to create a product that was not a complete disaster.\"), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"links\"\n  }, \"Links\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/ShabazBadshah/SpaceWars\"\n  }), \"Source Code\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=vSHpG_tWrcE\"\n  }), \"Video Demo\"))));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"This was the first video game I ever created.

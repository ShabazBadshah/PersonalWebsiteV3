Oh boy, was it frustrating at some points when I was trying to lay-out a specific item in a very distinct manner and it just wouldn't work; I definitely wanted to give up at those points. Regardless of the fact, CSS was the most difficult part of the website despite the site's simplicity.

Such inconsistencies included things such as images being centered on one device but not another.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My first attempt at a solution was using media queries for popular devices such as iPhones, iPads, Nexus phones, Galaxy S7, etc; this of course was a VERY BAD choice. This attempt was missing all the devices in between the popular ones (I realized later how bad of a design decision this was). The availability of media queries for the mainstream devices made this attempt relatively quick to implement (about 3 days). My second attempt was more sensible, it was to try to use a framework to help me solve all my consistency problems. Using a framework came with many advantages such as making the site easier to maintain, and also easily understandable by other developers. Implementing the Bootstrap CSS framework quickly solved my problem and I was able to finish the website within 3 weeks; not bad for a complete newbie I suppose :P.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"span\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"1200px\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n      \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"span\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n    \"href\": \"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/29114/mockup_1.png\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    },\n    \"target\": \"_blank\",\n    \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n  }), \"\\n    \", mdx(\"span\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"a\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"56.333333333333336%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  })), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"a\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"alt\": \"Kodeability site mockup\",\n    \"title\": \"Kodeability site mockup\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/c1b63/mockup_1.png\",\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/5a46d/mockup_1.png 300w\", \"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/0a47e/mockup_1.png 600w\", \"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/c1b63/mockup_1.png 1200w\", \"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/d61c2/mockup_1.png 1800w\", \"/static/8b72c117371a541b09acb30d505a9bcb/29114/mockup_1.png 1920w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\"\n  })), \"\\n  \"), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"what-did-i-learn\"\n  }, \"What did I Learn\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Other than improving my web development and design skills to a competent level, after much needed reflection I came to the obvious conclusion that I needed to think out my problems!

project-blurb: "This is the second iteration of my website. I streamlined the appearance significantly and removed some redundent aspects from the previous version. This site was done completely in CSS, HTML, jQuery, and Jekyll to ultimately keep it very simple. Feel free to use it as a template if you want (some parts of it are messy)."

                This second iteration of my site was primarily a redesign of my personal brand to tell a more consistent
                and streamlined story of myself and my works.

        <p class="article-paragraph ">
            There was minimal planning for this project, it didn't require any. I finished the site in about 2 days which 
            included redoing the CSS, throwing some javascript in the site for some dynamic content, and moving all my 
            old works from my previous site to this new one.

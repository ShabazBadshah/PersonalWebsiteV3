## Jira

* Jira is an issue tracker created by Atlassian
* Used for Agile project tracking and management and use-cases such as:
  * Tracking **Tasks**
  * Tracking **User Stories**
  * **Release Planning**
  * **Bug Tracking**
  * **Code Documentation and Investigation**
  * Tracking **Completion of a Project**
* Think of Jira as a **Bulletin Board** where everyone can see what's going on, and can track their own task updates

## Your Tasks

Let's run through Jira and use to create a task that we will take through the entire planning lifecycle

1. Log into your Jira account
2. **Click on "Projects"** in the top navigation bar
3. **Select your group project** (i.e. your team name)

### Creating a Story

1. **Click on "Create" in the navigation bar** to create an issue type
2. **Select issue type** in the dropdown and **click "User Story"**
3. **Type in the following information into the issue fields:**
   * Summary of the task (i.e. title of task that will show up in the sprint board)
   * Description of what needs to be done (using pictures and references is super helpful)
   * Select a priority
4. **Click "Create"**
5. The Issue will now appear in your **Backlog**

**Reminder:** _The Backlog is the location where all of your work goes before you bring it into a sprint and start working on it_

### Assigning Story Points

1. **Go to the "Backlog" View**
2. Click on the story you want to estimate and in the story pane that opens on the right hand side of the screen, **click on "Estimate" located under the issue summary**
3. **Assign a story point**

## Issue Types

There are 4 primary types of issues on Jira

1. __Epics__ - An issue that can contain stories, bugs, and tasks. Epics are cateogires for major functionality/tasks in a release. ```Think of epics like "folders" where you have similar content gathered together```. An Epic is a "non-technical" description that you would give someone (e.g. telling a marketing team about some new search feature coming out in your app)
2. __Story__ - An issue that described the requirements of a feature that needs to be implemented. A story has multiple "sub-tasks" that break down the story in implementable pieces.
3. __Bug__ - Descibred a bug found in the program that needs to be fixed.
4. __Task__ - Any non-feature related task can go in here. This is __not the same as a sub-task__.

---

## Example of Usig Different Issues

The issues go from very "non-technical" description to very "technical" description

- __Epic:__ Recipe Searching
  - Giving users the ability to search for recipes on the site will allow them to 
  - __Stories:__
    - Filter search results
      - __Tasks:__
        - Display filter results in HTML based on selected filter-type
        - Create filter-type dropdown in frontend
        - Migrate mundane filtering to use the strategy design pattern based on the selected filter
        - Write unit-tests for frontend
    - Responsive search bar for iPads
    - Save search queries

## Working on an Issue

When an issue is ready to be worked on (or has been planned to be worked on), it will be bought into a Sprint

1. **Drag the issue you created into a Sprint**
2. Right-click the issue id in the Sprint (e.g. TES-1)
3. **Click on "Assign", and type in the name of the individual who will be working on the issue**; then click "Assign" to confirm
4. **Click on "In Progress"** to begin working on the issue
5. _Work on the issue_
6. When an issue is complete, go into the issue and **press the . (period button) on your keyboard and type in "Log Work"**
7. Type in the amount of time you spent on the task and click "Log" to confirm.
8. Once the issue is complete, click on it's id and **click on "Done"**

---

## Searching for Issues

Jira has very powerful search features which can be used to filter for issues

1. **Click on the search bar** in the navigation bar
2. **Press <Enter>** on your keyboard
3. **Click on "Advanced"** beside the Search button. This will activate Jira's JQL (Jira Query Language) searching. It's very similar to SQL.
4. Try the following query `project = TestCSC301 AND issuetype = Story AND status = DONE`

---

## Let's Commit something to Github

1. Grab the issue tag of the task you created
2. Clone your project repos
3. Create file with called `your-name.txt`
4. Commit the task via the following format `[ISSUE-KEY] <commit message>`
5. Push to your repo

```shell
touch shabaz-badshah.txt
echo "Testing GitHub integration with Jira" > shabaz-badshah.txt
git add shabaz-badshah.txt
git commit -m "[TES-1] Issue complete"
git push
```

**Some keywords to remember in JQL**:

* Project: The project you want to search
* Status: The status of the task  (i.e. completed, done, in-progress, etc.)
* Issuetype: The type of the issue (i.e. a bug, task, sub-task, epic, story, etc.)

**Some Key Connectives**:

* AND
* OR
* NOT

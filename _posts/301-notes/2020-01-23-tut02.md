## Jira

- Jira is an issue tracker created by Atlassian
- Used for Agile project tracking and management and use-cases such as:
  - Tracking __Tasks__
  - Tracking __User Stories__
  - __Release Planning__
  - __Bug Tracking__
  - __Code Documentation and Investigation__
  - Tracking __Completion of a Project__
- Think of Jira as a __Bulletin Board__ where everyone can see what's going on, and can track their own task updates

## Using Jira

Visit [http://mcsapps.utm.utoronto.ca/jira](http://mcsapps.utm.utoronto.ca/jira)

## Your Task

Let's run through Jira and use to create a task that we will take through the entire planning lifecycle

1. Log into your Jira account
2. __Click on "Projects"__ in the top navigation bar
3. __Select your group project__ (i.e. your team name)

### Creating a Story

1. __Click on "Create" in the navigation bar__ to create an issue type
2. __Select issue type__ in the dropdown and __click "User Story"__
3. __Type in the following information into the issue fields:__
    - Summary of the task (i.e. title of task that will show up in the sprint board)
    - Description of what needs to be done (using pictures and references is super helpful)
    - Select a priority
4. __Click "Create"__
5. The Issue will now appear in your __Backlog__

__Reminder:__ *The Backlog is the location where all of your work goes before you bring it into a sprint and start working on it*

### Assigning Story Points

1. __Go to the "Backlog" View__
2. Click on the story you want to estimate and in the story pane that opens on the right hand side of the screen, __click on "Estimate" located under the issue summary__
3. __Assign a story point__

## Working on an Issue

When an issue is ready to be worked on (or has been planned to be worked on), it will be bought into a Sprint

1. __Drag the issue you created into a Sprint__
2. Right-click the issue id in the Sprint (e.g. TES-1)
3. __Click on "Assign", and type in the name of the individual who will be working on the issue__; then click "Assign" to confirm
4. __Click on "In Progress"__ to begin working on the issue
5. *Work on the issue*
6. When an issue is complete, go into the issue and __press the . (period button) on your keyboard and type in "Log Work"__
7. Type in the amount of time you spent on the task and click "Log" to confirm.
8. Once the issue is complete, click on it's id and __click on "Done"__

## Searching for Issues

Jira has very powerful search features which can be used to filter for issues

1. __Click on the search bar__ in the navigation bar
2. __Press \<Enter\>__ on your keyboard
3. __Click on "Advanced"__ beside the Search button. This will activate Jira's JQL (Jira Query Language) searching. It's very similar to SQL.
4. Try the following query ```project = TestCSC301 AND issuetype = Story AND status = DONE```

## Let's Commit something to Github

1. Grab the issue tag of the task you created
2. Clone your project repos
3. Create file with called ```your-name.txt```
4. Commit the task via the following format ```[ISSUE-KEY] <commit message>```
5. Push to your repo

```shell
touch shabaz-badshah.txt
echo "Testing GitHub integration with Jira"
git commit -m "[TES-1] Issue complete"
git push
```

__Some keywords to remember in JQL__:
  - Project: The project you want to search
  - Status: The status of the task  (i.e. completed, done, in-progress, etc.)
  - Issuetype: The type of the issue (i.e. a bug, task, sub-task, epic, story, etc.)
  
__Some Key Connectives__:
  - AND
  - OR
  - NOT

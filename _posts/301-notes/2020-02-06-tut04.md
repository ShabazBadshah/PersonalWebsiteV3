## What is Jenkins

Jenkins is a __automation__ server that can run any task you want. It's primarily used in the testing, deployment, delivering, or building of software. A primary use-case for Jenkins is to support Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Delivery (i.e. its used heavily in DevOps).

## Typical Jenkins Workflow

1. Write code
2. Run tests/code locally
3. Check code into source control
4. Jenkins job runs code checked in against additional tests, build steps, or any other task
5. If change "succeeds", it's merged with the master branch, which may be queued up for release to a customer or be released immediately

*Random Fact:* Netflix __deploys__ every 11.7s. [source](https://techbeacon.com/devops/10-companies-killing-it-devops)

## Jenkins Demo

We'll create a very simple task that will print out *"This is my Jenkins task running"* to the console.

### 1. Create a Folder

In the left-sidebar, click `New Item` → select `Folder` → give the folder a name by filling out the `Enter an item name` field → click `OK`

You'll then see the following page

![Naming folder](/assets/notes/301-assets/name-folder.png)

Give the item a name by typing it into the `Display Name` field. You can also add a description if you want. Folders will help you group similar tasks together.

Once done, click `Save` at the bottom-left of the dialog

### 2. Create Jenkins Job

In the left-sidebar, click `New Item` → select `Freestyle Project` → give the project a name by filling out the `Enter an item name` field → click `OK`

You'll then see the following page

![Freestyle project](/assets/notes/301-assets/freestyle-project.png)

1. Under `Source Code Management`. Select `Git` and paste in the link to a public GitHub repo in the `Repository URL` field

2. Scroll down to `Build environment` and select the `Delete workspace before build starts` option. This option will pull the latest version of your repo when running a job.

3. Scroll down to the build section and click on `Add build step`. Select `Execute shell` and type in `echo "This is my Jenkins job running"`. Once done you can click `Save`. 

`You can run any type of shell script in the "Execute shell"` option as if it was a local terminal that you were working with.

### 3. Run Jenkins Job

1. Go to the Jenkins homepge
2. In the left-sidebar click on you folder, then click on the job you made.
3. In the left-sidebar click the `Build Now` button. The build will then be queued under `Build History` directly below the sidebar.
4. Click on the most recent build number in the `Build Now` pane, and then click on `Console Output`. You'll see that you echo statement was sent to the console.

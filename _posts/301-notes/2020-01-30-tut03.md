## What are Pull Requests

Pull Requests (commonly denoted to 'PR') are a process in the software development cycle where __prior to merging a change onto the `master` branch, the code is reviewed by a peer__

PRs are:

- Industry standard
- Ensure visiblity of work by atleast 1 other person on your team (i.e. codebase knowledge isn't known by only one person)
- Attempts to ensure that the `master` branch (i.e. the branch you're releasing from, does not break)
- Attempts to reduce the amount of bugs being introduced on `master`

### Pull Request Flow

## Setting up GitHub Integration with MS Teams

You will be using Microsoft Teams for commmunication with your respective teams, and for __standup updates__

Integrating MS Teams with Github will send you push notifications whenever a pull request (PR) has been created

1. On your laptop, download [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads)
2. Log in with your UTOR account
3. Go to your Team
4. Click on the three-elipses beside your team name
5. Click on "Add Channel"
6. Type in the name of the channel and description, and click "Add"
7. Click on "Apps" at the bottom of the right sidebar
8. Type in "Github Enterprise"
9. Click "Add to a Team"
10. Type in "UTMCSC301" in the "Github Enterprise" connection field
11. Click "Create"
12. Follow remaining instructions in the MS Teams window pane

## Setting up Pull Requests on GitHub

1. Go to your project repos on Github
2. Click on the "Settings" tab towards the top of your page
3. Click on "Branches" in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Add Rule"
5. Type in "master" under "Branch Name Pattern"
6. Click on "Require pull request reviews before merging"
7. Click "Create"

## Planning Sprints

Planning sprints is essential to consistent development and releasing. It's how you "chunk" your work and ensure that they can be delivered on time.

- Involve the Product Manager, Scrum Master, and the Devlopment Team
- Dev team discusses complexity of story/requirement bought by PM and assigns story points once they've accepted it

## Plan your Next Sprint

1. Take two of your user stories from your Jira backlog
2. Discuss complexity of story and assign story points
3. Create __sub-tasks for each story__ breaking the story down

![Creating a Jira subtask](/assets/notes/301-assets/jira-create-subtask.png)

4. Ensure that __every member has a task assigned to them__
5. Prioritize stories based on importance
6. Move the stories into sprint

## Breaking down a Story into Tasks Example

__Story:__ As a user I want to be able to search my cooking site for recipes

__Possible Tasks Breakdown__

1. Send query from frontend to backend
2. Set up DB model to store recipes
3. Query database for recipe
4. Set up HTML view in frontend to display recipe results
5. Write backend tests for recipe queries

## Glossary

- __Pull Reqests (i.e. PR)__ - The reviewing of code by another team member prior to its merge with the master (i.e. release) branch
- __Scoping__ - Picking a set of features/tasks that can be completed in a timely manner (e.g. within a sprint, within a month, within an entire release, within a feature set, etc.)
- __Estimation__ - Assigning a numerical value (i.e. story points) to `User Stories` or `Spikes` to categorize their `complexity`
